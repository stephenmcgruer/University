{"name":"University","tagline":"A centralized listing of work completed during my university degree.","body":"### Overview\r\n\r\nThis page contains a list of courses that I took during my time at university, for which I have coursework-related files. I hope that the work stored in these repositories might be useful to someone, either as a learning tool or simply for amusement. However, I would caution the reader against two things. Firstly, although this work is my own, remember that most pieces of coursework are completed under tight time constraints, with an eye only on making it 'work' for those short few minutes it is being evaluated. As such, little of this work was written with maintainability in mind[^1], and so is definitely not production quality in any sense. Secondly, if you are still a student (particularly at Edinburgh University), it would be unwise to try and submit this work as your own; aside from the potential for your coursework to be subtly (or not so subtly) different from mine, the fact that all of these repositories are publicly accessible means it's very easy for plagiarism software to check them! Of course, since this is released under the WTFPL license (see below) I can't <b>instruct</b> you on what to do or no to do with it, only counsel...\r\n\r\n[^1] And often has way too many comments, as one can never be sure if a marker will actually understand the code...\r\n\r\n### Copyright Information\r\n\r\nI have striven to ensure that all of my University-related repositories do not contain any University of Edinburgh or University of Edinburgh staff owned work. However, if you feel that I have missed anything please reach out to me at <stephen.mcgruer@gmail.com> and I will be more than happy to correct the mistake.\r\n\r\nAside from any such mistakes, most of my work is under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/) license, excepting any third-party code (which will be clearly marked and licensed) and some of my more serious work (which will again be clearly marked).\r\n\r\n### Course Repositories\r\n\r\n#### 5th Year (Level 11, taken during 2012/2013)\r\n\r\n* [Algorithmic Game Theory and its Applications](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University-AGTA)\r\n* [Design and Analysis of Parallel Algorithms](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University-DAPA)\r\n* [Parallel Architectures](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University-PA)\r\n* [Parallel Programming Languages and Systems](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University-PPLS)\r\n* [Software Architecture, Process, and Management](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University-SAPM)\r\n* [Text Technologies](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University-TTS)\r\n\r\n#### 4th Year (Level 10, taken during 2011/2012)\r\n\r\n* [Advanced Vision](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University-AV)\r\n* [Communication and Concurrency](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University-COC)\r\n* [Compiler Optimization](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University-COPT)\r\n* [Computer Animation & Visualization](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University-CAV)\r\n* [Computer Graphics](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University-CG)\r\n* [Extreme Computing](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University-EXC) (Level 11)\r\n* [Human-Computer Interaction](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University-HCI) \r\n* [Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University-MLPR)\r\n\r\n#### 3rd Year (Level 9, taken during 2010/2011)\r\n\r\n* [AI Large Practical](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University-AILP)\r\n* [Computer Communications and Networks](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University-COMN)\r\n* [Operating Systems](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University-OS)","google":"UA-41117271-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
